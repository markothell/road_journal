August 7, 2013
=================

Ok. I'm on the road. <br>
Leaving Mound I found a nice paved trail sneaking it's way through the back yards of suburban
Minneapolis with its many lakes and beautiful dense marshes. It delivered me into downtown 
and I strolled around for a bit to catch a glimpse of Minnesota's city culture but was soon on my way. The trail 
system surrounding the twin cities is really quite impressive and made for simple navigation 
headed out of town.

Heading north and east of St. Paul I passed through a variety of suburban landscapes; residential
roads giving way to mall strips and highways with comfortable shoulders. Finally as I headed east 
towards the St. Croix river I saw more farm land and stretches of forest. Finally I found camp at 
state park near the quaint little Marine on St. Croix.

I finished the day pleasantly tired and with a few hours of daylight left I headed over to 
their 'recreational' area for a swim in the river. It was shallow with a gentle current and 
a sandy bottom and I strolled a ways downstream before grabbing a spot in the sun to write. <br>
A good day.
