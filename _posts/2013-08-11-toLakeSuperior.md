Day 4. After an uncomfortable night in the Chequamegon (sounds more like shewamegan) National Forest 
I continued north en route to lake Superior and Apostle Islands National Lakshore. A 
combination of tired, hungry, and sore both from the riding and rough ground the night before, 
I stopped in Iron River for some much needed refreshment. Along with lunch I picked up a bag
of doughnuts from the little bakery in town. The one above was like a doughnut and jelly sandwhich.
Wonderful.

Towns near water just have a different vibe and I was excited to see folks out enjoying music, 
the sun, and beach. One of a series of lakeshore towns, I stopped and explored Cornucopia a bit and chatted 
with folks about kayak trips out to the Apostle Islands(!). Sailboats are everywhere and I 
admired some still in storage near the harbor, stirring fantasies of future adventures. I 
grinned with excitement standing under this powerful looking lady.

Day 5. From what I hear there are amazing adventures to be had camping and exploring among the islands.
Turns out they don't let amateur kayakers take off into the (frigid) open water without some preparation, 
which, due to scheduling, was going to take a few days; more time than I want to spend. 
Also, the day trip for today was booked so I reserved a spot for tomorrow, Monday, and headed 
into Bayfield to enjoy a day sitting still.

I'll spend tomorrow on the water seeing the sea caves of Apostle Islands National Lakeshore 
then it's back on the road!
