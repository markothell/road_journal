September 1, 2013
=================

Ahhhhh! I've been struggling to keep up to date with the blog! I've had lot's of fun stuff to write about 
but time just keeps slipping away. 

For the last three days I've been in Pennsylvania camping with my mother in the Allegheny National 
Forest. I'm closing in on Pittsburgh and feel both thrilled to arrive and sad that suddenly 
the bike trip is almost over. What a wonderful anguish to have though--torn between adventures--for
there are beautiful people and foreign places ahead to explore. After Pittsburgh I'll be off 
to Portugal and who knows where else for who knows how long, travelling by foot, bus, train, 
plane and automobile. 

Below is an updated list of my progress across the map. Only about 150 miles left! I have had 
a few posts cooking for the last week or so and posting them now I'm calling this 'caught up'. I hope you 
enjoy!
