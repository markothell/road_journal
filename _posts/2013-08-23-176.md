TransCan 17<br>
Heading east from the border at Sault St. Marie the only road east is #17, the trans canadian highway. 
It's a two lane thoroughfare responsible for supporting all long distance travel across the province. 
For the most part it has soft gravel shoulders and only about a foot of pavement outside the 
lane of traffic. This can make for tense riding. Dump trucks and logging freighters come buzzing 
by within arms reach and the gravel to the right serves as very unstable bailing ground. I met 
a pair of bike tourers who reported having been riding for 1400km on this road, an unenviable 
pursuit. Add to this the long unspectacular stretches of flat straight roads and I was looking 
forward to moving past it.

Every morning along this stretch I felt I should stop riding, taking the day off. I would crash 
at some point during the day, try to refuel and keep going. I was motivated to reach a more suitable 
spot for a day of rest, in particular to make it to the Bruce Peninsula before 
my birthday where I could enjoy the day from a quiet camping spot on a spacious nature reserve. 

After a discouraging start on morning three I was reinvigorated by a noteworthy lumber jack platter at a restaurant 
in Spanish, Ontario. Early that afternoon I reached Espanola where I was finally able to take 
a right turn and head south on highway 6. A woman I met there described the road ahead, referring 
to one segment in particular as 'God's Country'. <br>
'You'll know it when you see it', she said.

Highway 6<br>
Right out of Espanola there was a marked change in terrain. I started climbing and rock faces 
rose around the road's twisting path. I passed a number of stunning rivers, waterfalls, shallow lakes. 
Gone was most of the truck traffic, the shoulders widened. Relief.

Soon the land flattened out again to a landscape scattered with lakes. I stopped many times to 
admire the wide open expanses, the sense of calm. I could see why it would carry a title like 
God's country. These were the iconic fields in my imagining of Canada (minus the herds of wild elk). 
My photos do it no justice.

The sun was setting in Little Current as I cooked dinner and I went down to the water's edge to eat. 
The night was cool and wet with dew from the tall grass I tented in.

In my fourth day through the Ontario I would take the ferry 
to Tobermory, the Bruce peninsula and hopefully settle into a relaxing spot for my day off.
