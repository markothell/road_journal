August 25, 2013
=================

I always thought it a fascinating process to watch babies as they begin to comprehend the world. 
The image in my mind is of a child turning its little hand, flexing its fingers in front of its face, 
transfixed, feeling surprise that those movements correlate somehow to its intention. There's a certain 
magic to the way that self-awareness unfolds gradually over time, layer upon layer of reality 
moving from obscure to visible to familiar to obvious, and then in a way, back to invisible again. 

I often see myself like that baby, suddenly marveling at a previously unseen truth lying right in 
front of my face. And when I think back to all the foolish, enthusiastically misplaced efforts of 
my life I can be thankful for one less source of chaos and confusion. It's for this reason that I 
celebrate the process of getting older; something like the potential for wisdom. 

Yesterday I turned 30. Despite the anticipated excitement about growing older I started the day with 
the familiar wince of tension about my lack stability in life. Looking at my day I realized that once again I 
had avoided planning and as a result hadn't secured a comfortable place of rest. My fearful brain 
asked, 'is this be representative of my life to come?'

I spent the morning writing, being quiet, and was on the road about noon. It wasn't long before I 
saw a sign for an organic bakery and excitedly pulled in for some sweets.

Surrounding the small bakery were gardens and walking trails, open grass and rope swings. Surprise,
delight. I purchased some snacks and set up at the picnic table under an apple tree with a picturesque 
spread of twisted branches.

As I sat eating, I realized that this would be an ideal place to spend the day. Again I felt tension 
though. I wanted to reward myself with a calming day but feared to impose by asking for another's 
sacrifice. (Reason also, I think, for a solo bike tour). I turned it over in my mind but as much as I 
wanted a piece of this beauty to keep I knew I would not ask permission to stay. I retured back 
to the bake shop for another round of treats, satisfied to enjoy what was on offer.

While waiting in line to order the gentleman behind me struck up a conversation. He asked about my ride 
and where I was headed. I explained how I was looking for a peaceful place nearby to take the day off.
He said he knew just the place. The next moment the proprietor had pulled out a map and Chris 
was drawing my route to a local cliffside sanctuary. How exciting. 

In the middle of his explanation Chris pauses. 'I usually don't do this, but actually, I have 
a little cottage near there on the water, and a bunk house where you can stay.' I watched in surprise as he 
wrote down the new directions and recommended scenic places to stop along the way. 

'I won't be back for a few hours so maybe meet me there after four?' 'Super, wonderful,' I 
responded. Again he paused, 'Actually, and really, I normally wouldn't do this, but if you get 
there before me there is a kayak and paddles and stuff in the boat house, you can take it out 
and explore the bay.' 'Wow, fantastic.' We shook hands as he departed and I took my snacks back 
to the garden, grinning in disbelief. Suddenly I was being offered copious gifts for this special day.

Along the way I stopped by Isthmus Bay outside of Lion's Head. Here was once again the most spectacular 
clear blue water I had ever seen. I sat on the white stone shore and had another snack. So, so beautiful.

Chris and I had dinner and talked into the night. I was inspired to hear about his work and family, 
to find that he was living so many of my aspirations. After dark, sitting lakeside by the fire, 
I pondered at the sequence of events. Why, though I struggled to ask for it, had I been provided 
with such abundance? (That's me the baby staring in wonder. Am I involved in this?)

I went to bed humbled and grateful, feeling like the universe had conspired to give me a spectacular 
day of celebration and welcome me into the next phase of my life.
