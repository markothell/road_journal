Day 7 <br>
It was cold and gray as I rode out of Ashland first thing in the morning. What was left of 
Wisconsin was a straight shot down highway 2. At the border I discovered the small town of 
Hayward's herculean effort in political incorrectness as I passed their football field.

Sister city to Hayward WI, is Ironwood MI. Both are quiet little towns with a historic Main St. 
business strips and friendly residents. I chatted with a pair of ladies named Barbara and had 
an outstanding breakfast at the Pines Cafe in Ironwood. A lady a couple tables down kept saying sheesh
and yaah with that northern drawl; my official introduction to the UP.

My next stop was in the Porcupine Mountains park. Heading north at Wakefield MI began some 
of the nicest riding I've had yet. Just a quiet two laned road, old growth forest on either side. 
I was thrilled to see this little river near the entrance of the park and stopped for a quick hike.
For whatever reason I was overjoyed to be in this place walking along the river.

From there began my unexpectdly long climb to the summit of porcupine mountain. Definitely the 
most challenging riding so far but well worth it. I parked in the summit picnic area and continued 
on the foot trail from there.
