Hello. Mark here. <br><br>
Tomorrow morning I'll head out on my next little bike tour. I'm starting 
in Mound Minnesota, a town just outside Minneapolis, and will finish in 3 or 4 (or 5)
weeks in Pittsburgh PA. I've got a handfull of decent maps (mostly in digital form), my 
panniers are stuffed, and I've laid out a rough idea of the route (see image above) 
passing through the upper peninsula of Michigan, Ontario around the northern curve of Lake
 Huron, with stops in Toronto, and Niagara Falls, then cutting across the western tip of New 
York and down across Pennsylvania.

Other than making last minute fixes to my bike and packing I've spent the last week hangin 
with my mother, her father and his twin brother. My grandfather is, to my knowledge, the sole possessor of 
any documented history of my family and we've spent hours digging through old photo albums
and listening to stories of centuries past. It's been a pleasure, and a great preparation for the road 
and the reflections that accompany.

And on more practical matters... 
I know this picture doesn't reveal much to my fellow bike tourers hoping for a gear list. 
And I may get more into gear selections as the trip goes on but suffice it to say the 
recent addition of front rack and extra set of panniers has made room for all sorts of 
extra unnecessaries, though not uncomfortably so based on my short test rides. 
Here she is all dressed up.

Ok. That's a start. Tomorrow I depart.
