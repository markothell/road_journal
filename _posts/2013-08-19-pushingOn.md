August 19, 2013
=================

Day 12 I spent the morning in camp at Pictured Rock. I had breakfast with Durk and Maloe, a couple 
from Amsterdam that introduced me to the cucumber and peanut butter sandwich. They said it 
calls for salsa as well, an idea which I'm on the fence about, but the simpler version has been 
added to the road repertoire. Regardless, it was great hanging with them!

An hour or so of riding brought me to Grand Marais. Though not as big as Munising, Grand Marais 
is another little harbor town that seems to be doing well on the outdoor sport and tourism of 
the area. I was sad to learn their library was closed indefinitely but luckily they had Wifi and electricity
in the waterfront park.

Dirt Roads!
===========

Planning my route forward, I had to pick between faster highways that cut away from the coast or 
smaller roads nearer the coast that included brief streches without pavement. And though I have 
struggled as a result of this decision in the past I chose to take a chance with the latter option.

One of the problems with dirt roads is that their quality is directly related to their proximity 
to town. Thus, they start out nice and firm, and by the time the wavelike ripples are having that 
numbing jack-hammer effect on your elbows and you're fishtailing through sand pits you're already 
commited and you figure, 'I might as well just push on through to the other side'. Little do you 
know the pain has only just begun. 

Another problem with dirt roads is that they are more likely to be innacurately mapped, further 
complicating the matter. There is nothing worse than being lost and unable to effectively ride your 
way out.

So, needless to say my offroad adventure was something of a detour but I had plenty of water and 
snacks to carry me through. I pushed on (with surprising patience considering past offroad meltdowns).

I picked a finishing destination of Newberry, MI and rode until sunset to get there. By days end 
it was one of my longest rides and certainly the most challenging. I bought a sausage and an ice 
cream cone at the local drive-in and headed to camp. Clouds of hungry mosquitos were there to 
greet me. Too tired to fight, I finished off my trail mix from the safety of my tent instead of cooking dinner.

Day 13

Though mosquitos have been consistently aggressive all during this trip, I havn't seen it 
as bad as outside Newberry. Stop for a few seconds and the whole cloud settles on you. I count 
16 here just on my pants!  

I find that the only real deterrent to mosquito attacks is long clothing. Any body part that is 
exposed will get bitten. I have even taken to wrapping up my head and neck. No more need to 
worry about that aggravating bzzzzzz in my ear.

I spent the morning at the library in Newberty working on the blog and started riding in the afternoon.
Next stop Sault St. Marie. Pronounced 'soo', the Sault is the town surrounding the Michigan, Ontario 
border and where I would cross into Canada. Again, the sun was setting when I got to town and I headed to the 
riverfront to see the famed locks. This time spelled like it's pronounced, the Soo Locks are where the giant freight 
ships travel from the higher elevation of Lake Superior down into the lower elevations of Lake 
Huron and Michigan (or vice versa). I watched as a ship entered the locks and slowly rose with the entering Lake Superior water.

The Sault's main strip was abuzz with trinket shops, restaurants and fresh fudge for sale. I rode around 
town absorbing the activity until after dark. At camp, a gaggle of geese socialized not far off, 
their outbursts often sounding like humans in celebration. 

Michigan's been good. Tomorrow on to Canada!
