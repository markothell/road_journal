###A brief summary of Niagara Falls.

Casino. Fast food chain. Casino. Family friendly food chain. Adventure tour kiosk. Tourists 
taking photographs. The elimination of public water fountains as part of a conspiracy to 
sell overpriced beverages from snack kiosk. Casino. Awe inspiring, roaring spectacle of nature.

Wow.

###The Long version

Stepping back a day...<br>
Rounding the western corner of Lake Ontario brings back the sensation of turning the corner of 
Lake Michigan heading south of Chicago and into Gary Indiana. I found myself lost in a decaying 
industrial center with crumbling roads, chugging smokestacks, electric line highways, and a noxious wind.

Finally I made my way to the lakefront and discovered a serene waterfront bike path which led me 
to Confederation Park and delight of delights of sub-urban camping; an abandoned and 
overgrown campground.

The next morning, day 22, started with a thick fog as I continued along the coast to Niagara on the 
Lake. By the time I intersected Niagara River the sky had cleared and I followed the riverside 
park all the way (through an increasingly thick tourist net) down to the falls.

In the lead-up to the falls I found particular excitement in the power infrastructure; some incredible
displays of human ingenuity.

After an number of lookouts, historical markers, and opportunities for extreme adventure tours, 
I finally arrived at THE falls. I was somewhat sad to see the main strip loudly decorated, 
offering endless opportunities to spend ones money, most prominently via the towering skyline 
of casinos and hotels. 

The falls are, of course, spectacularly powerful and an impressive sight. I joined the mass of 
tourists with my camera at ready but I was soon ready to move on. I spent my last couple 
Canadian dollars and headed for the Rainbow Bridge. Back to the land of the free.
