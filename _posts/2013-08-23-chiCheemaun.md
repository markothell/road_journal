The ride to South Baymouth from Little Current made for another uncomfortable morning. At this 
point I'm feeling worn dry, dead and my ass is burning from rider rash after a long hot and 
sweaty ride the day before. Still, I am cloud gazing all the way there. Another beautiful day!

I arrived in South Baymouth just as the ferry line was filling up. Luckily there's always room 
for an extra bicycle. Another bike tourist, Arthur, was there waiting to cross to the peninsula as 
well. Aurthur is an engineering student on summer break from France on a three month ride across 
Canada!

Once landed in Tobermoray, Arthur and I headed south in search of camping. Surprisingly the 
first two campgrounds were booked for the weekend, including the National Park where I'd hoped to spend the next day off. 
Finally we found a spot at the Miller Lake Family Campground. Many of the residents 
there are semi-permanent, spending the summer months in lovingly adorned trailers with built on 
decks and landscaped yards.

It was nice to call it a day early but this wasn't the sanctuary I was seeking for my now 
fabled day off. After 11 days of solid riding I'd be back on the road one more morning in 
search of that elusive goal.
