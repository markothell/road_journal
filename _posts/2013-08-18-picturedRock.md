August 18, 2013
=================

I spent night 10 just off the shore of lake Superior outside Au Train. On the road early,
I stopped in Munising to shop and prepare breakfast. Munising is a major departure point for 
explorations into the Pictured Rock National Lakeshore and I watch packed tour boats depart 
from the harbor as I sat in the sun eating. 

On the way out of town I stopped at the DNR visitor station to inquire about camping along the 
lakeshore. To my surprise there is an extensive network of campsites, set up 
wonderfully for backpacking adventures along the lake superior shore, and they were 
nearly all booked full. I got one of the last spots at a little walk-in site toward the northern end 
of the park, paid my five dollars (!!) and was on my way.

Miner's Castle was described as the must see lookout along the lakeshore and I was happy to have taken 
the detour to get there. Miner's Castle is the prominent rock pictured above but the real sight (in 
my opinion) was the colored sandstone cliffs and the clear, brilliant blue waters which characterize 
the Pictured Rock lakeshore. Such blue waters, I could scarcely believe I was in the midwest.

After a few hours of quiet backroads riding I arrived at Twelve Mile Beach, my set out point for camping.

I have rarely seen water so clear and blue, certainly never in the United States. As I swam out 
over the still surface I was brought to laughter at the experience of it. So wonderful! Just 
the calmness of the surface was magical, like swimming in a pond that stretched on forever, alone 
in a world of water. I swam out until I was tired, admiring the sandy bottom far below. 

All along these beaches there is a 15 foot strip of rocks at the waters edge. The many beautiful 
stones look to me like a rock collector's dream.

Of all the places I have been Pictured Rock is certainly one to return to. Next time for 
some backpacking!
