August 27, 2013
=================

Heavy clouds were moving in as I prepared to leave the cottage in Lion's Head and the gentle 
rain that began to fall soon after my departure was the first of my journey. Finally, in Wiarton, 
ON a solid rainfall began and I pulled off under an awning to cover the gear on my rack.

The rain continued intermitantly as I rode on south, tired but satisfied. Before long I saw 
a small car pull onto the shoulder ahead of me and for a moment I wondered if they had stopped to 
tell me something. 

Next I looked, the car's passengers were standing on the shoulder doing something like a touchdown 
celebration dance. I looked closer. Holy shit! It was Durk and Maloe, the Dutch couple I had met 
at Pictured Rock. Last I saw them they were nearly finished with a road trip around Lake Michigan 
and here they were a week later in Ontario. We met in the road and high-fived in mutual celebration.

'Let's put your bike in the car! We're going to Toronto!'
'No, no,' Durk corrected, 'let's not pressure him. He should do what he feels.'

I thought about it for a moment, weighed the purity of my BICYCLE journey with having some 
drinks with these two in Toronto. In the mean time we chatted a little, trying to figure 
out how we had managed to meet again. I mentioned how I had spent my birthday the day before and they 
broke into Dutch, singing and waving their hands. 

'Fuck it,' I said, 'let's go to Toronto!'
