August 27, 2013
=================

Heavy clouds were moving in as I prepared to leave the cottage in Lion's Head and the gentle 
rain that began to fall soon after my departure was the first of my journey. Finally, outside Wiarton, 
Ontario a solid rainfall began and I pulled off under an awning to cover the gear on my rack.

The rain continued intermitantly as I rode on south, tired but satisfied. Before long I saw 
a small car pull onto the shoulder ahead of me and for a moment I wondered if they had stopped to 
tell me something. 

Next I looked, the car's passengers were standing on the shoulder doing something like a touchdown 
celebration dance. I looked closer. Holy shit! It was Durk and Maloe, the Dutch couple I had met 
at Pictured Rock. Last I saw them they were nearly finished with a road trip around Lake Michigan 
and here they were a week later in Ontario. We met in the road and high-fived in mutual celebration.

'Let's put your bike in the car! We're going to Toronto!'<br>
'No, no,' Durk corrected, 'let's not pressure him. He should do what he feels.'

I thought about it for a moment, weighed the purity of my BICYCLE journey with having some 
drinks with these two in Toronto. In the mean time we chatted a little, trying to figure 
out how we had managed to meet again. I mentioned how I had spent my birthday the day before and they 
broke into Dutch, singing and waving their hands. 

'Fuck it,' I said, 'let's go to Toronto!'

A few hours later I sat hiding from the rain on a downtown Toronto street with an uneasy feeling 
in my belly. I was waiting at our rendezvous point, suddenly faced with the realities of being in a 
city, with nowhere to stay on a rainy weekend night. After feeling cradled in the warm embrace of 
'the universe' the night before, now I was cast out into the cold wet world of cement and skyscrapers.
What was I thinking?

But then Durk and Maloe showed up smiling and ready to go and my fears were pleasantly postponed. 
We had dinner and a few drinks, walked Queen St. West and finally went our separate ways around 
bar close.

A lesson in Canadian friendliness
=================================

Aware that there were a handful of parks along the waterfront I headed south to the shore and 
rode east in search of a place to sleep. Before long I found a clean but deserted business park 
with a view of the shipping docks. I plopped down on a park bench and threw an arm over my eyes. 
After a few hours of uneasy sleep the rain started again and I moved underneath an overhang 
along the glass-walled corporate center that was host to the park. A couple more hours passed 
sleeping when I heard two sets of footsteps approaching. I opened my eyes to see to men in 
uniforms standing above me.

'Good morning sir.'<br>
'Good morning.'<br>
'Is everything alright?'<br>
'Yes.'<br>
'Were you able to get some rest?'<br>
'Yes.'<br>
'Very good. Well, we have opened the building here and saw you on the surveillance cameras. 
And if everything if all right, and you are rested, we would like for you to move on soon.'<br>
'Ok. No problem'<br>
'Thank you. Take your time. 15, 20 minutes, gather yourself, and have a nice day.'
'OK. Thanks so much.'

Wow! All day I reflected on this interaction. I'm not accustomed to receiving such respect from 
authority figures in every day life, let alone while found sleeping on the ground. +1 for Toronto!
