<p>Day two offered clear skies and nice roads. I followed county highway 95 up the St. Croix river and crossed into Wisconsin at Falls on the St. Croix. Even before crossing, the landscape started to form gentle rolling hills and for a brief stretch approaching the border the road was lined with sheer rock cliffs and the deep river gorge.</p>

<p>Once in Wisconin I found the Gandy Dancer trail which I ended up riding for a big chunk of the day. It&#8217;s a well kept pee gravel trail, which being an old rail line, had a nice gentle grade.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I cut east and ended up with a camping spot on an old blocked and grown over road in the Polk County Forest (above).</p>

<p>It would be my first night in the wild so bears were in the back of mind. I cooked a little ways down the road and hung my food up in a tree. I probably didn&#8217;t go as far as they said you should or hang my cooking clothes with the food but I wasn&#8217;t that far from civilization so I figured I&#8217;d be ok.</p>

<p>A few hours after falling asleep I was awakened in a panic by the sound of an animal breathing loudly near my tent. A series of forceful exhales echoed through the silent woods sounding like a bursts of steam from an old locomotive. 10, 20 seconds it continued, over and over. What the fuck animal was making these noises?! It was so loud.</p>

<p>My heart raced as I tried to decide what to do; grab my knife, put on my pants and prepare to escape, make noise and try to scare it, lay still. I did the last, frozen with fear as I imagined the creature closing in on me. I chastised myself for my carelessness, for cooking too close to my tent, for not reviewing bear country protocol. I had no idea what I was supposed to do.</p>

<p>After a brief pause the breathing started again and I started making some noise, after which everything went quiet. Reprieve. And with a calmer mind I could remember being startled by a deer on a night hike that had exhaled like that. Still, I have a renewed motivation to learn what should be done in a bear encounter. A topic to visit later.</p>

<p>I was up and back on the road first thing the next morning. All the fields were foggy, the roads empty, and looking into the distance it was like I was above the clouds.</p>

<p>And after my little scare in the night guess what crossed my path soon after sunrise. A black bear! He was a little guy, maybe two feet tall. We both stopped and looked at eachother. I reached for my camera and he dashed off.</p>
