<p>I always thought it a fascinating process to watch babies as they begin to comprehend the world. The image in my mind is of a child turning its little hand, flexing its fingers in front of its face, transfixed, feeling surprise that those movements correlate somehow to its intention. There&#8217;s a certain magic to the way that self-awareness unfolds gradually over time, layer upon layer of reality moving from obscure to visible to familiar to obvious, and then in a way, back to invisible again.</p>

<p>I often see myself like that baby, suddenly marveling at a previously unseen truth lying right in front of my face. And when I think back to all the foolish, enthusiastically misplaced efforts of my life I can be thankful for one less source of chaos and confusion. It&#8217;s for this reason that I celebrate the process of getting older; something like the potential for wisdom.</p>

<p>Yesterday I turned 30. Despite the anticipated excitement about growing older I started the day with the familiar wince of tension about my lack stability in life. Looking at my day I realized that once again I had avoided planning and as a result hadn&#8217;t secured a comfortable place of rest. My fearful brain asked, &#8216;is this be representative of my life to come?&#8217;</p>

<p>I spent the morning writing, being quiet, and was on the road about noon. It wasn&#8217;t long before I saw a sign for an organic bakery and excitedly pulled in for some sweets.</p>
<div class='img'>

</div>
<p>Surrounding the small bakery were gardens and walking trails, open grass and rope swings. Surprise, delight. I purchased some snacks and set up at the picnic table under an apple tree with a picturesque spread of twisted branches.</p>

<p>As I sat eating, I realized that this would be an ideal place to spend the day. Again I felt tension though. I wanted to reward myself with a calming day but feared to impose by asking for another&#8217;s sacrifice. (Reason also, I think, for a solo bike tour). I turned it over in my mind but as much as I wanted a piece of this beauty to keep I knew I would not ask permission to stay. I retured back to the bake shop for another round of treats, satisfied to enjoy what was on offer.</p>

<p>While waiting in line to order the gentleman behind me struck up a conversation. He asked about my ride and where I was headed. I explained how I was looking for a peaceful place nearby to take the day off. He said he knew just the place. The next moment the proprietor had pulled out a map and Chris was drawing my route to a local cliffside sanctuary. How exciting.</p>

<p>In the middle of his explanation Chris pauses. &#8216;I usually don&#8217;t do this, but actually, I have a little cottage near there on the water, and a bunk house where you can stay.&#8217; I watched in surprise as he wrote down the new directions and recommended scenic places to stop along the way.</p>

<p>&#8216;I won&#8217;t be back for a few hours so maybe meet me there after four?&#8217; &#8216;Super, wonderful,&#8217; I responded. Again he paused, &#8216;Actually, and really, I normally wouldn&#8217;t do this, but if you get there before me there is a kayak and paddles and stuff in the boat house, you can take it out and explore the bay.&#8217; &#8216;Wow, fantastic.&#8217; We shook hands as he departed and I took my snacks back to the garden, grinning in disbelief. Suddenly I was being offered copious gifts for this special day.</p>
<div class='divider'>---------------------</div>
<p>Along the way I stopped by Isthmus Bay outside of Lion&#8217;s Head. Here was once again the most spectacular clear blue water I had ever seen. I sat on the white stone shore and had another snack. So, so beautiful.</p>

<p>Chris and I had dinner and talked into the night. I was inspired to hear about his work and family, to find that he was living so many of my aspirations. After dark, sitting lakeside by the fire, I pondered at the sequence of events. Why, though I struggled to ask for it, had I been provided with such abundance?</p>

<p>I went to bed humbled and grateful, feeling like the universe had conspired to give me a spectacular day of celebration and welcome me into the next phase of my life.</p>
