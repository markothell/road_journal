<p>Ok. I&#8217;m on the road. <br /> Leaving Mound I found a nice paved trail sneaking it&#8217;s way through the back yards of suburban Minneapolis with its many lakes and beautiful dense marshes. It delivered me into downtown and I strolled around for a bit to catch a glimpse of Minnesota&#8217;s city culture but was soon on my way. The trail system surrounding the twin cities is really quite impressive and made for simple navigation headed out of town.</p>

<p>Heading north and east of St. Paul I passed through a variety of suburban landscapes; residential roads giving way to mall strips and highways with comfortable shoulders. Finally as I headed east towards the St. Croix river I saw more farm land and stretches of forest. Finally I found camp at state park near the quaint little Marine on St. Croix.</p>

<p>I finished the day pleasantly tired and with a few hours of daylight left I headed over to their &#8216;recreational&#8217; area for a swim in the river. It was shallow with a gentle current and a sandy bottom and I strolled a ways downstream before grabbing a spot in the sun to write. <br /> A good day.</p>
